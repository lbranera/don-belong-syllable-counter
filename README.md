# Don Belong Syllable Counter

This program provides descriptive statistics on the syllables in a given Ilokano literary piece. Users should upload the literary pieces (in `.txt` format) to the `./input` folder.

The program generates two types of output:

- A `.csv` file containing the descriptive statistics.
- A `.png` file displaying the histogram of line syllable count values.
